# Minecraft Assembly Language
The macro language that compiles to Minecraft circuitry.

MCA provides a relatively high-level macro-based language that introduces compile-time variables, functions, and operations.

This repository contains the MCA compiler, which compiles down the an intermediate language (named MCIL) made up of the raw commands and circuit configuration, as well as an MCIL compiler that can output a schematic or single 'installation' command-block.

Both language and compiler documentation is [available on the wiki](https://github.com/toxic-spanner/MCA/wiki).
